# River Green Dental Care - Automation for Treatment Plans in OpenDental

This program aims to automate certain inputs (namely, priority and diagnosis) of treatments in the treatment plan section of OpenDental.


## Setup
To use the attached binary, first download the [Java runtime environment](https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp). This will allow you to run Java files. Then download the .jar file down below.
You can save the file anywhere, but remember where it is and copy the path.

In OpenDental, go to Setup > Program Links > Add

Copy the info here, and replace the path of file to open with the path of the downloaded file.

Clicking the AutoPriority button on the top bar should now open the application.
