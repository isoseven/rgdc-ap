# Tasks to Fix - Priority List

## CRITICAL ISSUES
1. **Failing Test**: TeethNotationUtilTest (0/1 passing) - broken core functionality
2. **Manual Testing Backlog**: 89 unchecked items in docs/test.md - no systematic testing done

## CLEANUP TASKS  
3. **Debug Code**: 44 [DEBUG_LOG] statements to remove from production code
4. **Unsafe Array Access**: TreatmentPlanProcedureListCell.java lines 45-51 need bounds checking

## IMPROVEMENTS
5. **Test Coverage**: Only 2 test files exist, need more comprehensive testing
6. **JAR Deployment**: Verify manifest issue from README_FIX.md is resolved

## QUESTIONS
Which should I prioritize first?
- Fix failing test immediately?
- Clean up debug statements?  
- Work through manual testing checklist?
- Add automated tests?
